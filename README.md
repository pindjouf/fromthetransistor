# From the Transistor to the Web Browser 🌐

**A self-guided journey** inspired by [George Hotz's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) course, this project follows a comprehensive and **hands-on approach** to understanding the entire modern computing stack—from the **fundamental transistor** to **building a functional web browser**! Each section involves constructing key components, using tools like **Verilog**, **Python**, **C**, and **Haskell** while focusing on both hardware and software development. 🎯
