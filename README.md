# From the Transistor to the Web Browser 🌐

**A self-guided journey** inspired by [George Hotz's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) course, this project follows a comprehensive and **hands-on approach** to understanding the entire modern computing stack—from the **fundamental transistor** to **building a functional web browser**! Each section involves constructing key components, using tools like **Verilog**, **Python**, **C**, and **Haskell** while focusing on both hardware and software development. 🎯

## 📚 Course Overview

This project focuses on **building a computing stack step by step**, starting from hardware design, moving through processors, compilers, operating systems, and finally networking and browser technologies. To see the full roadmap and dive into each section, check out the [course outline](https://github.com/pindjouf/fromthetransistor/blob/master/misc/course_outline.md). 🛠️

## 🏃‍♂️ Progress Tracker

### ⏳ Current Task

➡️ **Making a [UART](https://github.com/pindjouf/uart)**: Implementing a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) in **Verilog** is the current focus. This helps in learning hardware description languages and chip-level design. 💻

| Task           | Progress |
| ---------------| -------- |
| UART (Verilog) | 🔄 In Progress |
| ARM CPU        | ⏳ Upcoming |
| Operating System| ⏳ Upcoming |
| Web Browser    | ⏳ Upcoming |

## 🌟 Project Goals

- 🧑‍🏭 **Design hardware** from the ground up, starting with logic gates.
- 🖥️ **Build a custom ARM CPU** and deeply understand its architecture.
- 🛠️ **Develop a custom OS**, C compiler, and toolchain.
- 🌐 **Master networking** by building a **TCP stack**.
- 🌍 **Construct a text-based web browser**.
- 🤖 Eventually run everything on an **FPGA** for a fully functional, real-world computing system.
